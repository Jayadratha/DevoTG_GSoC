# DevoTG: Developmental Temporal Graph Networks

## ðŸ§¬ Project Overview

DevoTG is a comprehensive framework for analyzing developmental biology through the lens of temporal graphs. This repository provides tools for processing, analyzing, and visualizing complex biological network data as it changes over time.

The project currently focuses on two key areas of *C. elegans* development:
-   **Connectome Maturation Analysis**: Processing and visualizing the entire C. elegans neuronal connectome as it develops from birth to adulthood, based on the Witvliet et al. (2021) dataset.
-   **Cell Division Tracking**: Applying Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) to model and predict spatiotemporal patterns in C. elegans embryonic cell division.

This dual focus allows researchers to explore both neural development and cellular lineage within a single, powerful framework.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### ðŸ”¬ C. elegans Connectome Analysis
-   **DTDG Data Processing**: Automated download and conversion of the Witvliet et al. developmental connectome datasets into a Discrete Time Dynamic Graph (DTDG) format.
-   **Network Growth Analysis**: Quantitative analysis of how the connectome grows, including metrics like density, degree, and synapse count over time.
-   **Connection Stability**: Classification of synaptic connections as stable, developmental, or variable throughout maturation.
-   **Advanced Visualization**:
    -   Static plots of global network metrics.
    -   Animated MP4 videos showing the dynamic growth of the connectome.
    -   Interactive HTML plots and dashboards for deep exploration of network topology (via Plotly).

### ðŸ§  Cell Division & TGN Modeling
-   **Temporal Graph Networks**: Applying TGN models to developmental biology data for link prediction.
-   **Interactive Visualization**: Creating 3D animations and interactive plots for cell lineage insights.
-   **Data Processing**: Converting biological cell division datasets into graph-structured formats.
